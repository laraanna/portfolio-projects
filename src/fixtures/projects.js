Realizing that technological innovations change how we learn and work, I created an interactive storybook based on the kids book series ‘Little People, Big Dreams’. The series discovers the lives of outstanding female figures in histories, such as Frida Kahlo or Rosa Parks. With Coco Chanel - the 3D Designer, I rendered the story of Coco Chanel, adapting it to today’s technological advances and told a slightly different story: Coco, creating 3D patterns, using milk as an ingredient to grow her own textiles and finally showing her fashion collection on VR-goggles.
